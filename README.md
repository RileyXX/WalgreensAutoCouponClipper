## Notes/Limitations:
- Sending too many requests at once can result in your IP being temporarily banned from accessing the Walgreens website. Try not to paste the code twice or run it too many times within a short time frame. It is recommended to use a VPN, but it's not necessary. If your IP gets banned, simply click the shield button in the navigation bar of your browser and delete all the cookies for Walgreens.com. Then change your VPN server or wait (the duration of the ban can vary, ranging from a few minutes to 24 hours).
- Walgreens.com allows clipping up to 200 coupons.
