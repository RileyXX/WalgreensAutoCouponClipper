## Notes/Limitations:

* Sending too many requests at once can get your IP temporarily banned from accessing the walgreens website. Try not to paste the code twice or run it too many times during a small time frame. Recommended to use a VPN but not necessary. If your IP gets banned simply click the little shield button in the navigation bar of your browser and delete all the cookies for walgreens.com. Then change VPN server or wait (not sure how long but could be anywhere from a couple minutes to 24hours)
* Walgreens.com only let's you clip up to 200 coupons.
